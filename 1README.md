# Bike_Rental
On a daily basis, different kind and different number of users rent bikes. The number of users depend upon various factors such as environmental, seasonal and even holiday factors. The aim of this project is to predict the total number of users who are expected to rent bikes based on these different factors so that the required number of bikes can be made ready daily and this can increase the cost efficiency by reducing the wear and tear and servicing cost of the company and give us an idea about how many bikes should be serviced and kept ready beforehand to meet the demand.
